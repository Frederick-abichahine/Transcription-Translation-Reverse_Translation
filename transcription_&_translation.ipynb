    "#on the screen for the user. After that, the program prompts the user for a protein ID and checks if that ID is found\n",
    "#within the given sequences. If not it prompts the user again, and if it found a match it then displays all the \n",
    "#statistics for that protein's DNA and then displays the mRNA sequecne for that specific protein ID and also displays\n",
